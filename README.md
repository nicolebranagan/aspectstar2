# Aspect Star 2
## Introduction
Aspect Star 2 is a new retro-styled action-adventure game, primarily but not solely taking its inspiration from games of the 8-bit console era. Particular effort is placed in providing not only a game but a game engine, along with editor, that can be taken up and used to make any sort of game. To that end, the game engine (but not the game assets themselves) are placed under the MIT open-source license.

## Progress
Aspect Star 2, both the engine and the game, are currently under active development. The game is not yet feature or level-complete, and any features currently present are subject to change or be removed at any time.

## Demo releases
One demo has currently been released, containing a single playable dungeon.

## Dependencies
Aspect Star 2 uses the Jint library to provide scripting for in-game objects and rooms.
