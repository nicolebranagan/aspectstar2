    ===ASPECT STAR  2===
     BY NICOLE BRANAGAN
	 
Introduction
------------

Aspect Star 2 is the sequel to Aspect Star, an older game of mine you can see
on my website (http://nicole.express/?games/as1) if you're interested.
However, there is no need to have played the first game to enjoy the second
one.

Aspect Star 2 is a retro-esque game (it does not match the limitations of the
NES, but is inspired by them) done in the style of action-adventure games like 
Startropics or The Legend of Zelda. If you've played those games, playing AS2 
should come naturally.

Story
-----

Aspect Star 2 takes place in the Empire, a powerful state that has brought
peace to the known world under the banner of its benevolent leader, Princess
Mary. Unfortunately for the known world, the Princess has been kidnapped!

As the Princess' girlfriend, Nicole, you must go on a quest to find the eight
golden keys and unlock a path to the Imperial Palace, where the Princess is
being held. Can you do it? Hopefully!

And please do forgive the self-insert ^^;;;

Playing the game
----------------

The game supports both keyboard and gamepad controls. Gamepad controls require
Xinput, and use the directional pad, the START button, and the A and B buttons.
No configuration changes are needed to switch between Keyboard and Gamepad
controls.

Keyboard controls can be set in the OPTIONS menu. The default keyboard controls
are as follows:

UP - Up arrow key
DOWN - Down arrow key
LEFT - Left arrow key
RIGHT - Right arrow key
A - X key
B - Z key
START - Enter key

The game has two modes, World Map and Adventure Screen. In the World Map,
Nicole can move four-dimensionally using the directional keys, and pause using
the START key. The game can be SAVED at any time while on the World Map in the
pause menu.

In the Adventure Screen, the A and B buttons will allow you to use two of your
abilities. Which ones can be selected in the pause menu, activated by pressing
START. The directional keys move your character as usual. Projectile weapons
are always fired in the same direction Nicole is facing, and certain weapons
will not function if Nicole is standing directly against a wall. Nicole can
jump when in the Adventure Screen; this is an ability like any other, though
by default it is tied to the A button.

Towns and cities are also Adventure Screens. To talk to someone, just walk into
them, and if they have anything to say, they'll say it.

System Requirements
-------------------

Aspect Star 2 currently requires the Windows operating system, and the .NET
Framework 4.5. A DirectX 9.0c capable GPU is also required.

The Linux/OpenGL release version requires installation of the Mono runtime.
